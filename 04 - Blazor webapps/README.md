# Blazor
---


## Web Frameworks

1. Having an easier way to produce end-result HTML, CSS, and dynamic behaviour (instead of writing all of those from scratch)

2. Provides a logic & service layer in between front-end / UI code and back-end data.

3. Modeling client-server interactions so you don't have to manually manage *infrastructure* while developing your web application.

- component-based: reusable components.
 kind of like classes. everything is a component; the entire application is a component and every little thing inside it is just a nested component


## Razor

The templating language used as an intermediary to translate C# objects and logic to rendered HTML.

## Blazor

A web framework for the .NET runtime -- almost like a "modernised" way of working in ASP .NET Core, but with the workflow cleanliness and consision of modern JS-based web frameworks like React, Vue, Angular.

A more legible overview of Blazor basics than the official Microsoft documentation can be found at [Blazor University](https://blazor-university.com/).
